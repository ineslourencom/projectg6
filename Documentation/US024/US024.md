As Administrator, I want to get a list all user accounts and their status.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> When you create a new record, your "active" is created as inactive (boolean false). At the same time an 
> e-mail message is sent to the user that will allow them to activate the account, through a code 
> or an automatic activation link.
