# US 026 - To Define the Product Owner of a Project 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


- As Director, I want to define the PO of a project


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>"(...)the project team, PO and SM donâ€™t change during the sprint."(v3, p4, l2)
>
**From the Product Owner clarifications:**
> **Question:** To define the PO of a project, should we select someone from the team,
> or do we add a new member? (G6, 25/01)
>
> **Answer:** The Director appoints someone.
> Does not have to be someone previously attached to the team, on the contrary. (27 jan via MSTeams)
> 


> **Question:** According to the specifications document, the PO, as well as other team members, 
> should not change during a sprint. However, during the last sprint review, it was noted by the POs 
> that this might be too restrictive, since due to an unforeseen situation, it might be necessary to replace
> a human resource at any time. For our project, and specifically for US27, the date a PO initiates functions
> might be any day date after the project start, or should necessarily coincide with the begining date of a sprint?
> (G6, 28/01)
>
> **Answer:** The PO might be changed at any time. (AMM, 31/01)


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The resource to appoint as PO must not be a member of the team.
* **AC2:** The cumulated percentage of allocation of a worker in all projects in which he/she participates cannot exceed 100
* **AC3:** There must only be one active PO in a team at any time.
* **AC4:** The Product Owner role cannot be cumulated with other roles within the project.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* Dependency from US015 - As Director, I want to get a list of all projects.
* Close relaion with US024 - As Administrator, I want to get a list all user accounts and their status - 
Might be helpful to know the existing user accounts. Ideally, the Director would select one, instead of insering the accoun's email
* Close relation with US028 - As Director, I want to get a list of all human resources in a project-
The Director might want to know the resources already allocated to the project.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**
	
* Selected data:
    * Project to appoint PO
    * Cost per hour currency
    *  Start date of the PO functions
    *  End date of the PO functions


* Typed data:
    * Email of the resource to appoint as PO
    * Percentage of allocation
    * Cost per hour of the resource


**Output Data:**

* In case of success: a DTO containing information about the created resource is returned
* In case of insuccess: 
a BusinessErrorMessage is returned containing an informative message
about the cause

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale



| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 / 2 		  |	... interacting with the actor?     | UpdatePOUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  	 
| Step 3              |...instantiate dto? |UpdatePOUI| IE: knows user input data
|                     |	... coordinating the US? | UpdatePOController | Controller  
|                     |... find the selected account? | AccountStore  | IE: contains all existing Accounts  |
|                     | ... find the selected project? | ProjectStore  | IE: contains all existing Projects  | 
| 		  	          |	... determine if percentage of allocation is valid? | ProjectStore  | IE: contains all existing Projects, and each project its own resources and respective percentage of allocation |
| 		  	          |	... determine if project is closed? | Project  | IE: knows its own state |
|                     |	... determine if indicated user already plays a role in the team? | Project  | IE: knows its own resources |
|                     |	... validate start date? | Project  | IE: knows its own state |
|                     |	... know if there is an active PO? | Project  | IE: knows its Resources |
|                     |	... set end date of PO resource? | Project  | IE: knows its Resources |
|                     |	... create a new Resource? | Project  | Creator:  Project aggregates resources in its team |
| 			  	      |	...saving the new Resource?						 | Project  | IE: knows its Resources |
|  Step 4             |	... informing operation success?| UpdatePOUI   | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  |
|

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Account
 * Resource
 * Project

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 



 Entities:
* lklk

Value Objects:
* lklkj
