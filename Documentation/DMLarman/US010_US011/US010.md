# US 010 - Update Account Data 

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As an Authenticated User, I want to update my own account data (e.g., photo, function).



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each user's registration must request at least the following information:
>- Name; 
>- Function; 
>- E-mail; 
>- Password; 
>- Password confirmation; 
>- Photo (optional).
>
(page2.line11)

>	Creating accounts in the system must ensure that the email address used is unique.
>
(page2.line18)

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Does the change to #US010 "As an Authenticated User, I want to update my own account data (e.g., photo, function)." reflect the clients idea for this User Story?
>  
> **Answer:** It does.

-

> **Question:** What are the account data fields that can be edited by the user?
>  
> **Answer:** Photo and Function (generally, trivial attibutes i.e. fields not involved in user authentication / account validation).


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** the photo must be in .png format.
* **AC2:** job function name must have at least 4 chars.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There are dependencies to "US001 - As Non-Registered User, I want to register as an application user.", "US002 - As Non-Registered User, I want to activate a just registered user account.", "US003 - As Visitor, I want to send a request to the administrator to assign him/her a given profile." and "US006 - As Administrator, I want to update profiles assigned to a user account." since at least an active account with a profile other than "Visitor" must exist for it to be able to be edited (page2.line22).


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* a job function
	
* Uploaded data:
	* a photo 


**Output Data:**

* List of updated account data
* Success (or lack thereof) of the operation

### 3.1. Rationale

**SSD - Alternative 1 is adopted.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | CreateTaskUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | CreateTaskController | Controller                             |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Task? | Organization   | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Organization has a Task.   |
| 			  		 | ... knowing the user using the system?  | UserSession  | IE: cf. A&A component documentation.  |
| 			  		 |	... knowing to which organization the user belongs to? | Platform  | IE: has registed all Organizations |
| 			  		 |							 | Organization   | IE: knows/has its own Employees|
| 			  		 |							 | Employee  | IE: knows its own data (e.g. email) |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |	...saving the inputted data? | Task  | IE: object created in step 1 has its own data.  |
| Step 4  		 |	...knowing the task categories to show? | Platform  | IE: Task Categories are defined by the Platform. |
| Step 5  		 |	... saving the selected category? | Task  | IE: object created in step 1 is classified in one Category.  |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 7  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Task | IE: owns its data.| 
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | Organization | IE: knows all its tasks.| 
| 			  		 |	... saving the created task? | Organization | IE: owns all its tasks.| 
| Step 8  		 |	... informing operation success?| CreateTaskUI  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Organization
 * Platform
 * Task

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * CreateTaskUI  
 * CreateTaskController

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Task instance = new Task(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Task instance = new Task("Ab1", "Task Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}


*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateTaskController 

		public boolean createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Integer catId)() {
		
			Category cat = this.platform.getCategoryById(catId);
			
			Organization org;
			// ... (omitted)
			
			this.task = org.createTask(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			
			return (this.task != null);
		}


## Class Organization


		public Task createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Category cat)() {
		
	
			Task task = new Task(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			if (this.validateTask(task))
				return task;
			return null;
		}



# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some tasks are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain. 

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
