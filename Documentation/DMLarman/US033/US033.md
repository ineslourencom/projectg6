# US 033 - To register work in a task

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an SM / Team Member, I want to register work done on a Task.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

> A user story may include several tasks that have to be done for the user story to be completed. During the sprint, project team members register work done in these tasks. (page 4, lines 4-5)

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When the SM / Team Member wants to register work done on a task, are they registering only hours spent or do they register / add also a comment? (G4, 30/01)
> 
> **Answer:** It may make sense to register comments. (AMM, 31/01)

> **Question:** When the SM / Team Member works on a project can they have more than one role in it?
> 
> **Answer:** No, one resource can only have one role at a time. Roles may be changed though.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* AC01-1. Hours spent is a decimal number.
* AC01-2. Hours spent are non-negative.
* AC02-1. Comment is optional.
* AC02-2. Comment is a string.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* The starting point of this user story assumes the use of user story US017 to choose a project and US016 to choose a task to which we submit work done.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data:**

* Selected data:
    * a project from a list of projects where the user has an active role in (this selection returns an email and a project code to the system);
    * a task from a list of tasks of a project where the user has an active role in (this selection returns an email, a project code and a task number to the system);
    * an "input work done" option button. 
    
* Typed data:
  * hours spent on task;
  * optional comment on the work done.

**Output Data:**

* "Work done submitted" confirmation - OK / NOK.

### 2.2. Other Remarks

There are implementation side effects to the adoption of this model. One such example is that any work with effort eligible for registration on the system can only exist within the scope of sprints / user stories. This is a feature that has been confirmed by the PO.  

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... retaining this data?				  | AddWorkDoneController            |  IE: is responsible for user interactions.    |
| Step 2  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | AddWorkDoneUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  	 |	... coordinating the US? | AddWorkDoneController | Controller                             |
| Step 3  		 |	... requesting data?				  | AddWorkDoneUI            |  IE: is responsible for user interactions.    |
| Step 4  		 |	... saving the input data? | EffortUpdate  | IE: object created in step 4 has its own data.  | 
|      		     |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Task | IE: Task knows and maintains the EffortUpdate.| 
| 			  	 |	... instantiating a new EffortUpdate? | Task   | Creator (Rule 1): in the DM Task maintains EffortUpdate.   |
| 			  	 | ... knows the EffortUpdate?   | Task  | IE: Task retains full knowledge and  responsibility for EffortUpdate.  |
| Step 5  		 |	... informing operation success?| AddWorkDoneUI  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual class promoted to software classes is:

* EffortUpdate

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* AddWorkDoneUI
* AddWorkDoneController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

**Note that:**

* "set" methods were completely avoided
* OO' best principles are being followed

As a result, the conceptual solution is easier to understand and maintain.

**We should adopt this approach.**

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

**Note: private and non-used methods were omitted.**

# 4. Tests

Three relevant test scenarios are highlighted next.
Other test were also specified.

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the EffortUpdate class with invalid values.

    @Test
    void submitWorkDoneTestFail() {
        AddWorkDoneController addWorkDoneController = new AddWorkDoneController();
        BusinessSector businessSector = new BusinessSector(123456, "description");
        ProjectTypology projectTypology = new ProjectTypology(123, "nametest", "descriptiontest");
        Customer customer = new Customer("name", 123456789);
        Project testProject1 = new Project(1, "Test Project One", "test project",
                1, 1, 2022, 2, 3000, customer, businessSector, projectTypology);
        ResourceRole testResourceRole1 = new ResourceRole("Scrum Master", "test description");
        ITCompany.getITCompany().getProjectStore().saveProject(testProject1);
        PasswordHash newPasswordHash = new PasswordHash("123");
        Account testAccount1 = new Account("kevin@isep.ipp.pt", newPasswordHash, "Kevin the tall Minion",
                "test dummy for code");
        Resource testResource1 = new Resource(LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1), 30,
                10, testAccount1, testResourceRole1, testProject1);

        UserStory testUserStory1 = new UserStory(1, "Test", "This is a detail", 1);
        Sprint sprint1 = testProject1.createSprint(LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 15));
        Task result = sprint1.createNewTask("taskOne", "testOneDescription", "Meeting", null, null, null, null, testUserStory1);


        ITCompany.getITCompany().getProjectStore().findProjectByCode(1).determineRunningSprint().findTaskByCode(1).createEffortUpdate(4, "this is a task comment", testResource1);


        assertFalse(addWorkDoneController.submitWorkDone("kevin@isep.ipp.pt", 1, 1, -4, "this is another task comment"));
    }


**Test 2:** Check that it is possible to create an instance of the Category class with valid values.

    @Test
    void submitWorkDoneTestSuccess() {
        AddWorkDoneController addWorkDoneController = new AddWorkDoneController();
        BusinessSector businessSector = new BusinessSector(123456, "description");
        ProjectTypology projectTypology = new ProjectTypology(123, "nametest", "descriptiontest");
        Customer customer = new Customer("name", 123456789);
        Project testProject1 = new Project(1, "Test Project One", "test project",
                1, 1, 2022, 2, 3000, customer, businessSector, projectTypology);
                ResourceRole testResourceRole1 = new ResourceRole("Scrum Master", "test description");
        ITCompany.getITCompany().getProjectStore().saveProject(testProject1);
        PasswordHash newPasswordHash = new PasswordHash("123");
        Account testAccount1 = new Account("kevin@isep.ipp.pt", newPasswordHash, "Kevin the tall Minion",
                "test dummy for code");
        Resource testResource1 = new Resource(LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1), 30,
                10, testAccount1, testResourceRole1, testProject1);

        UserStory testUserStory1 = new UserStory(1, "Test", "This is a detail", 1);
        Sprint sprint1 = testProject1.createSprint(LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 1), LocalDate.of(2022, 2, 15));
        Task result = sprint1.createNewTask("taskOne", "testOneDescription", "Meeting", null, null, null, null, testUserStory1);


        ITCompany.getITCompany().getProjectStore().findProjectByCode(1).determineRunningSprint().findTaskByCode(1).createEffortUpdate(4, "this is a task comment", testResource1);


        assertTrue(addWorkDoneController.submitWorkDone("kevin@isep.ipp.pt", 1, 1, 4, "this is another task comment"));
    }
